1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?

	new builds a new unsaved record and renders the form. create, on the other hand, saves the record to the database.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?

	New and save will emulate the same behavior as create.

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?

	Timestamps exists on every table even though we didn't define it.

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?

	c = Cat.new(name: 'hat').save

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?

	The most confusing part was getting Rails to work properly. Whenever I invoked commands specifically for rails, there were always problems such as not having JSON.

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?

	I liked this homework because we still dealt with deploying our information onto a webpage, and we created forms. I would say that this is my second favorite homework, while Homework 2, aside from all of the Windows-related bugs, was my favorite.
